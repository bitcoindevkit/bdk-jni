Install Open JDK 14 or later if not already installed and make sure your `JAVA_HOME` env variable is
set and `java --version` is found and displays the the correct version.

If you haven't installed rust android targets first add those to your environment using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
```sh
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64-linux-android aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android
```

Then make sure that you have an Android NDK installed ([our Github CI is using 21.4.7075529](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-10.15-Readme.md), 
and that you have an `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` env variable set before you start building the library. 
Usually, if installed through the `sdkmanager`, your `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` will look more or less like 
this: `/home/<user>/Android/Sdk/ndk/<version>/`.

```
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/home/<user>/Android/Sdk/ndk/<NDK version, ie. 21.4.7075529>
```

Build and unit test jvm .jar and build android .aar libraries with:
```sh
./gradlew build
```

Test android .aar library connected unit tests with:
```sh
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Gradle will build automatically the native library with rust for all 4 platforms using NDK. You can 
choose to build only for a specific platform by setting the env variable `BUILD_TARGETS` to a 
comma-separated list containing one or more of the following items:

* `aarch64`
* `armv7`
* `x86_64`
* `i686`

The output aar library is available at `./android/build/outputs/aar`.

To run the tests first launch a local android emulator from the Android Studio IDE or via the 
command line. If starting from the command line you will also need to set the `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` 
env variable.
```
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=</home/<user>/Android/Sdk or where ever your Sdk is installed>
```

### Publish .aar and .jar files to local maven repository

Use the below command to publish the jvm .jar and android .aar files generated by this project to 
your local maven2 repository (~/.m2/repository/org/bitcoindevkit/bdkjni/bdk-<jvm or android>):
```sh
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Once published you will see two new artifacts in your local maven repository:
```sh
~/.m2/repository/org/bitcoindevkit/bdkjni/bdk-jvm/<version>/bdk-jvm-<version>.jar
~/.m2/repository/org/bitcoindevkit/bdkjni/bdk-android/<version>/bdk-android-<version>.aar
~/.m2/repository/org/bitcoindevkit/bdkjni/bdk-android-debug/<version>/bdk-android-debug-<version>.aar
```

When you include the `bdk-android.aar` or `bdk-android-debug.aar` library in a local Android project
the `bdk-jvm.jar` will also be included as a transitive dependency. To include dependencies from your
local maven repository add `mavenLocal()` to the `allprojects` section of your project 
`build.gradle` file:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        ...
    }
}
```

At the moment we recommend using the `bdk-android-debug` version of the library so it can be debugged 
and used locally in the IDE. Because you added your local Maven repository to your `build.gradle` 
file, you can now simply add `bdk-android` or `bdk-android-debug` to your `app/build.gradle` dependencies:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.bitcoindevkit.bdkjni:bdk-android-debug:0.2.1-dev'
    ...
}
```

### Using the `bdk-jvm` library
The `bdk-jvm` library will attempt to load the native library (the `libbdk_jni.so` file) when you call the `Lib.load()` method. You must put the native library in the path it searches by default or you provide a custom paths in order for the library to find the native library. Do do this, you can either:
1. Run the app without doing anything special and see the error thrown. You can then place the native library for your architecture (located in the /`target` directory) in one of those locations
2. Define a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable with a path to a location where you put the native library file
3. Call your application from the command line while providing a `java.library.path` variable.

### Build just the native library

If you only want to build the native library, maybe for one single platform, you can do so with something like:
```sh
CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER="aarch64-linux-android21-clang" CC="aarch64-linux-android21-clang" cargo build --target=aarch64-linux-android
```

Make sure that the compiler from the NDK is in your PATH

If the library is built in debug mode, there should already be a symlink from 
./target/debug/<target>/libbdk\_jni.so to the `jniLibs` directory, otherwise manually copy the shared object.
